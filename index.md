## R3 Day 100: 2020-06-28 Sunday

### [Microservices Ticketing Site](https://github.com/virtual/microservices-ticketing)

Auth service

- New auth folder
- `npm init -y`
- `npm install typescript ts-node-dev express @types/express`
- `tsc --init`
- create `auth/src/index.ts` (ts!)
- update package.json: `"start": "ts-node-dev src/index.ts"`

Setup K8s early on!

- Make sure we can build an image, we'll need a Dockerfile (`FROM node:alpine...`)
- We'll also add .dockerignore to avoid copying over node_modules folder to image
- Try building image
- Now add k8s info in `infra/k8s`
- Create auth-depl.yaml
- Everytime we create a deployment, we'll want to create a service to go along with it
- Create service information inside the same auth-depl.yaml file

Skaffold

- From root of project, create `skaffold.yaml` and fill in
- Test run with `skaffold dev`
- Note on `-poll` (I use `poll` a lot for other projects!)
  - If you did not see your server restart after changing the index.ts file, do the following:
  - Open the package.json file in the ‘auth’ directory
  - Find the ‘start’ script
  - Update the start script to the following:
  - `ts-node-dev --poll src/index.ts`

## R3 Day 99: 2020-06-27 Saturday

`addMarker(mappable: User | Company): void { }`

- To allow for multiple type as an argument, use a bar as an OR operator
- This compares the available properties in each
- Only properties that exist in _both_ (and have the same types) can be used within this function call
- This can get messy as we scale, as we need to manage the types, eg: `User | Company | Parks | CarLots`...
- Instead, invert the setup and make the class types work with the CustomMap class needs

```ts
interface Mappable {
  location: {
    lat: number;
    lng: number;
  };
}
// Ideal things we can do with the map in index.ts
export class CustomMap {
  // addMarker(mappable: User | Company): void {
  // Instead of maintaing list types, we can use the Mappable type
  addMarker(mappable: Mappable): void {}
}
```

Typescript does an implicit check of User and Company to make sure they pass as type Mappable

To help identify errors in classes we can use `export`:

```ts
// by adding export, we can use this to help with error checking in User
// and Company classees
export interface Mappable {}
```

And then add `implements` to the Class itself

```ts
import { Mappable } from './CustomMap';
// Since we export Mappable, we can use implements
// (not extends!) Mappable to help id errors
// Not required, but helpful :)
export class User implements Mappable {}
```

Now errors will show inside the User class showing expectations of Mappable

**Typical Typescript file**

- Interface definitions for working with this class
- Class definition

Review of why this project used Parcel: "Parcel is a Web Application Bundler. It's in the same tool category of _webpack_, with a different value proposition. Parcel promises to do many things without any configuration at all, and be fast too."

## R3 Day 98: 2020-06-26 Friday

- `npm install faker` - allows generation for fake data
- Error: 'could not find declaration file for module': if you include a file that isn't Typescript, it can't determine TS types
- Type definition files (`name.d.ts`) tells the TS compiler the functions that are in a file and what kind of types it takes/uses
- Precreated type definition files can be found from "Definitely typed", eg `@types/faker`: use install `npm install @types/faker`
- After install, the error should magically go away :)
- Command click on import variable to view typescript def file

Example of User.js that creates a user with faker data; uses the export keyword:

```ts
import faker from 'faker';

export class User {
  name: string;
  location: {
    lat: number;
    lng: number;
  };

  constructor() {
    // generate random info using faker
    this.name = faker.name.firstName();
    // this.location.lat -- this is undefined!
    this.location = {
      lat: parseFloat(faker.address.latitude()), // return a number to match definition above
      lng: parseFloat(faker.address.longitude())
    };
  }
}
```

```ts
import { User } from './User';
// anything we export something from a file, we use curly braces
// this allows us to export mulitple items with diff names
// different from `export default` as that will be the default
// export default is rarely used in TS
const user = new User();
```

- By adding the following into our `index.html`, we have created a _global_ variable `google`: `<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=API_KEY"></script>`
- However, TS files do not understand that this global var is available
- We can use the [type definition files](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/googlemaps) for these situations as well
- We can reference this in the top of the file as `/// <reference types="@types/googlemaps" />`
- Command+shift+P inside a TS file and choose Fold Level 2 to fold all level-2 headings
- `opts?` is a flag for optional argument

Limit access to methods on third-party plugins:

```ts
// Instead of creating and calling this directly in index.ts, let's
// create a Map class to limit the functionality allowed in index.ts
const map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map'), {
  zoom: 2,
  center: {
    lat: 0,
    lng: 0
  }
});
```

## R3 Day 97: 2020-06-25 Thursday

**Constructors**

```ts
// way 1
color: string;
// a constructor is instantly executed and uses arguments
constructor(color: string) {
  this.color = color; // if you use a constructor, then don't define it above
}
// end way 1

// way 2 -- add public, equivalent to way 1!
constructor(public color: string) { }
// end way 2
```

constructors that extend a parent class need `super()` calls

Going to use `npm install -g parcel-bundler` for packaging TS code going forward

## R3 Day 96: 2020-06-24 Wednesday

**Typescript Classes**

- A blueprint to create an object with some fields (values) and methods (functions) to represent a 'thing'
- Inheritence: (Car is a type of Vehicle) extends a class to use another Class's methods

```ts
// refer to as the Super Class
class Vehicle {
  drive(): void {
    console.log('chugga chugga');
  }
  honk(): void {
    console.log('beep');
  }
}
// refer to as the Child Class
class CarClass extends Vehicle {
  // copies all props from Vehicle
  // if we want to override, we can
  drive(): void {
    console.log('vroom');
  }
}
const carInstance = new CarClass();
carInstance.drive();
carInstance.honk();
```

Modifers: keywords we can place on methods and props inside a class

- **public**--can be called anywhere, anytime
- **private**--can only be called by _other methods_ in _this class_
- **protected**--can be called by other methods in _this class_, or by other methods in child classes

Notes:

- If you override the method in a child class, you cannot change the modifier

## R3 Day 95: 2020-06-23 Tuesday

**Tuples:**

- array-like structure where each element represents one property about a record
- contains multiple properties to describe one thing
- drink example `[color, carbonated, sugarContent]`
- order is critical
- could be useful for CSV files (rows)

```ts
const pepsiArray = ['brown', true, 40];
const pepsiTuple: [string, boolean, number] = ['brown', true, 40];

// Can also be done as a "type alias"
// not an array--> defines the tuple!
type Drink = [string, boolean, number];
const coke: Drink = ['brown', true, 39];
const tea: Drink = ['brown', false, 15];
```

**Interfaces in Typescript**

- Interfaces + Classes = strong TS code
- Creates a new type, describing the property names and value types of an object
- Used for 'gatekeeping' and ensuring an object has the right type (good for code reuse!)
- Create functions that accept arguments that are typed with interfaces
- Object/classes can decide to do 'implement' a given interface to work with a function

```ts
interface Vehicle {
  name: string;
  year: number;
  broken: boolean;
}
const listVehicle = (vehicle: Vehicle): void => {
  console.log(`Name: ${vehicle.name}`);
  console.log(`Year: ${vehicle.year}`);
  console.log(`Broken: ${vehicle.broken}`);
};

// Refactoring
// Q: But what happens to all the type checking for the vehicles?
// Q: Can we have optional, but defined, variables in the Interface?
interface Reportable {
  summary(): string;
}
const car1 = {
  prop1: 'vw',
  summary(): string {
    return `This ${this.prop1} is awesome.`;
  }
};
const printSummary = (item: Reportable): void => {
  console.log(item.summary());
};
printSummary(car1);
```

## R3 Day 94: 2020-06-22 Monday

- You can assign multiple types to a variable
- Type inference on functions only works for the return type, not the argument type(s)

`let numberAboveZero: boolean | number = false;`

Destructured function example:

```ts
const logWeatherDestr = ({
  date,
  weather
}: {
  date: Date;
  weather: string;
}): void => {
  console.log(date, weather);
};
```

Object example:

```ts
const {
  coords: { lat, lng }
}: { coords: { lat: number; lng: number } } = profile;
```

## R3 Day 93: 2020-06-21 Sunday

### Typescript

What is it? Basically:

- JavaScript
  - arrays
  - arrow functions
  - destructuring
- plus a type system
  - uses 'type annotations' to analyze our code

Typescript:

- Helps identify bugs in development
- Only active during dev
- Compiles as normal javascript
- Does not change speed/performance
- Add to environment `npm install -g typescript ts-node`
- test with `tsc --help` (typescript compiler)

Resources:

- [Typescript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html)
- [Testing API](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)

FetchJSON app

- compile with `tsc index.ts` (creates compiled js)
- run with `node index.js`
- `ts-node` compiles and executes in one command
- Create an interface and tell TS that an object uses that interface `as Todo`

Primitive types:

- number
- boolean
- void
- undefined
- string
- symbol
- null

Object types: (we can tell TS to treat as a diff Object type)

- functions
- arrays
- classes
- objects

Inferences vs. annotation

- If we declaration and initialization are done on the same line, Typescript can infer the type for us: `const color = 'red'`
- If on two separate lines, `let apples;` & `apples = 5`, typescript gives apples a type of any and is not able to infer the type
- Avoid variables with type 'any' at all costs!

## R3 Day 92: 2020-06-20 Saturday

Reviewing the setup of our first Microservices app and setup for next

- Biggest challenge: handling data
- Focus on async communication
- Async communication focuses on communicating changes using events sent to an event bus
- Async encourages each service to be 100% self-sufficient
- Docker makes it easier to package services
- Kubernetes makes it easy to deploy and scale microservices

Review upcoming ticket app

Data

- User
- Order
- Ticket
- Charge

Services

- auth
- tickets
- orders
- expiration
- payments

- Client: Will be using React with Next.js -- Next.js is a server-side rendering React framework
- Service: node & mongodb; node & Redis (expiration)
- services will use a common library
- in place of event bus, we'll use NATS streaming server

## R3 Day 91: 2020-06-19 Friday

### Microservices: Skaffold

- Current workflow includes building each image, pushing to Docker hub and running `kubectl rollout restart deployment [depl_name]`
- While this is a good process for rolling out updates to production, is there an easier way to make changes while doing development?

[Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/)

- Automates many tasks in a k8s **dev** envionrment
- Makes it easy to update code in a _running pod_
- Makes it easy to create/delete all objects tied to a project at once
- Skaffold runs outside of cluster
- skaffold.yaml (in root folder) is a config file only used by Skaffold
- run with `skaffold dev`
- Quit with `ctrl+c`, Skaffold will remove objects (services, deployments, etc)

## R3 Day 90: 2020-06-18 Thursday

Exploring Deno with Bozeman JS group :)

## R3 Day 89: 2020-06-17 Wednesday

Adding Ingress config:

Create `ingress-srv.yaml` and apply file

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-srv
  annotations: # helps ingress understand that we are sending it routing rules
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
spec:
  rules: # all the routing rules to teach ingress how to route incoming traffic
    - host: posts.com # ingress assumes you may be hosting multiple domains
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /post # match what the posts/index.js expects traffic on
            backend:
              serviceName: posts-clusterip-srv # send requests to this service
              servicePort: 4000 # matches what is in posts-depl.yaml port
```

### Ingress host

- Since Ingress requires a host (eg post.com), we need to trick our localhost to thinking it's post.com
- Edit `/etc/hosts` file (Mac)
- ```bash
  # kubernetes microservices-blog
  # connect to localhost
  127.0.0.1 posts.com
  ```
- Now you can go to http://posts.com/posts in your browser
- Gather a list of all axios requests, POST, GET, etc
- For each of these requests, update ingress-depl.yaml with these route handler
- Ingress cannot choose based on method (POST, GET) so every method using the same route will need a unique ID: POST /posts or GET /posts are not unique enough

### Getting React to work in cluster

- Update all references to localhost to posts.com (or whatever you called your dev site); eg. `http://localhost:4000/posts` becomes `http://posts.com/posts`
- Create a Docker image of the client folder
- Push to Docker hub and create deployment & cluster ip configs

Q: Issue with adding a post and refreshing; need to rebuild query service in order for new posts to show up?

- A: Routes in event-bus/index.js needed to refer to the service :)

## R3 Day 88: 2020-06-16 Tuesday

Outside world -> Load Balancer -> Ingress Controller -> Cluster (Pod)

- We will be using [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx)
- Install per instructions
- Confirm the ingress-nginx-controller deployment exists: `kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx`

## R3 Day 87: 2020-06-15 Monday

- Microservices: update remaining services to use event-bus
- After creating all docker images and pushing them to Docker hub, create K8 depl files for each image
- Rebuild the folder of `infra/k8s` using `kubectl apply -f .`
- Test using postman

Integrating React portion

- We'll use a Load Balancer Service to give the browser access to the posts, comments, etc services
- Load Balancer Service: tell K8s to reach out to its provider and provision a load balancer. Gets traffic in a _single_ pod
- Ingress (Controller): A pod with a set of routing rules to distribute traffic to other services

## R3 Day 86: 2020-06-14 Sunday

### Keyword Universe clusters

- More clusters! But this time in SEO.
- Import all keyword info and competitor keyword info into a sheet with keyword, monthly search volume and keyword difficulty (and later cluster, modifier and sub-category)
- Create keyword clusters using the free [Keyword Grouper Tool](https://marketbold.com/KeywordGrouperPro/app/)
- Bring these keywords into your sheet and use VLOOKUP to match your terms with their cluster
- Also create a modifier column and filter (How, What, When, Why, Where) to get a better understanding of possible questions
- Create sub-categories on your cluster groups if they make sense
- This information also helps with understanding the Information Architecture (IA) for your website

## R3 Day 85: 2020-06-13 Saturday

### Setting up Cluster IP service

Add cluster IP service to existing deployment file for each pod config to make it easier to manage incoming requests

**How to Communicate between services**

- Reference other Cluster IP services based on their name (as shown when you do `kubectl get services`)
- For example, `await axios.post('http://localhost:4005/events'` would become `await axios.post('http://event-bus-srv:4005/events'`
- Redeploy (see R3D82 _Updating deployments_)
- Test a Post in postman to `localhost:30594/posts`

## R3 Day 84: 2020-06-12 Friday

### Setting up Cluster IP service

Will allow posts and event bus to talk to eachother

- Build an image for the Event Bus
- Push the image to Docker Hub
- Create a deployment for Event Bus
- Create a Cluster IP service for Event Bus and Posts
- Wire it all up

## R3 Day 83: 2020-06-11 Thursday

Made a quick Go program for a GDG meetup with James Perkins!

madlibs/main.go

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var exclamation string = ""
	var adverb string = ""
	var noun = ""
	var adjective string = ""

	fmt.Print("Enter a exclamation!")
	fmt.Scanln(&exclamation)
	fmt.Print("Enter an adverb!")
	fmt.Scanln(&adverb)
	fmt.Print("Enter a noun!")
	fmt.Scanln(&noun)
	fmt.Print("Enter an adjective!")
	fmt.Scanln(&adjective)

	fmt.Println(exclamation+"!", "She said", adverb, "as she jumped into her",
		adjective, noun, "and drove off with her", adjective, "dog.")
}
```

## R3 Day 82: 2020-06-10 Wednesday

### Updating deployments

Recommended method using Docker Hub (no need for hardcoded versions)

1. The deployment must be using the 'latest' tag in the pod spec sections
1. Make the updates to your code
1. Build the image
1. Push the image to docker hub: `docker push satinflame/posts`
1. Run the command: `kubectl rollout restart deployment [depl_name]` (depl_name should refer to the deployment NAME when you view `kubectl get deployments`)

### Services

_K8s Services provide networking between pods_

Types of services:

- **Cluster IP**: sets up an easy-to-use URL to access a pod. Only exposes pods _in the cluster_.
- **Node port**: allows access to a pod _outside the cluster_; used for dev only.
- **Load Balancer**: makes a pod accessible _outside the cluster_; this is the right way to expose a pod to the outside world.
- **External Name**: redirects an in-cluster request to a CNAME URL.

Creating a NodePort service in posts-srv.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: posts-srv
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: posts
  ports:
    - name: posts
      protocol: TCP
      port: 4000
      targetPort: 4000
```

```bash
k apply -f posts-srv.yaml
service/posts-srv created

k get services
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP          2d19h
posts-srv    NodePort    10.102.129.168   <none>        4000:30595/TCP   19s
```

NodePort now available (30595) and you can access this endpoint at `http://localhost:30595/posts`

### Understanding a Pod Spec

- apiVersion v1 is the basic "pool" of K8s objects
- a dash (-) means the item is an array entry
- if the image is "latest", K8s will try to find the image from docker hub

### Common Kubectl Commands

- `kubectl get pods` - list running pods
- `kubectl exec -it [pod_name] [cmd]` - execute a command in a running pod
- `kubectl logs [pod_name]` - print pod logs
- `kubectl delete pod [pod_name]` - Use delete to destroy and recreate (restart) pod
- `kubectl apply -f [config.yaml]` - tell K8s to process config (start pod)
- `kubectl describe pod [pod_name]` - print info about running pod (debug)

### Bash Alias

- [How to Create Bash Aliases](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-create-bash-aliases/)
- ~/.bashrc:

```bash
alias k="kubectl"
```

- enable with `source ~/.bashrc`
- for Mac, add to ~/.bash_profile:

```bash
# Get the aliases and functions
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
    . ~/.bashrc
fi
```

### Deployments

- A pod manager
- Typically we run deployments instead of configs for a single pod
- Deployments run multiple identical pods with the same config file
- Recreates pods if they crash or disappear
- Creates pods for a new version and sunsets old pods
- replicas: the number of pods to be created by deployment

posts-depl.yaml
(No longer going to use posts.yaml for single pod)

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: posts-depl
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: posts
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: posts
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: posts
          image: satinflame/posts:0.0.1
```

- Now if you delete a running pod, the deployment will automatically recreate a new one

### Common Deployment Commands

- `kubectl get deployments` - list running deployments
- `kubectl describe deployment [deployment_name]` - print out info on a deployment
- `kubectl apply -f [config.yaml]` - create deployment from config
- `kubectl delete deployment [deployment_name]` - Use delete to destroy a deployment (and delete related pods)

## R3 Day 80: 2020-06-08 Monday

### Kubernetes

- Container: an instance of a Docker image
- `kubectl` - the command to interact with a K8s cluster
- K8s will look at your local machine first to see if a Docker image is available

Kubernetes vocab:

- Cluster: a master of nodes and a master to manage them
- Node: virtual machine; the computer that will run some number of containers for us
- Pod: the smallest deployable units of computing that can be created and managed in Kubernetes; Pods run a single container (could have multi)
- Deployment for a service - monitors a set of pods/containers created and responsible for recreating pods when a service crashes, etc.
- Service - provides an simple URL to access a running container; gives us access to running pods inside our cluster, handles networking

**Always use config files to create Objects--Deployments, Pods, and Services; do not type direct commands**

### Config

- Start by creating a new versioned tag: `docker build -t satinflame/posts:0.0.1 .`
- Create /infra/k8s/posts.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: posts
spec:
  containers:
    - name: posts
      image: satinflame/posts:0.0.1
```

- cd to k8s folder and run `kubectl apply -f posts.yaml`
- `kubectl get pods` - return a list of running pods

## R3 Day 79: 2020-06-07 Sunday

Create Dockerfile for posts

- Use `.dockerignore` file to ignore `node_modules` and other directories you don't want copied to the Docker image

Common commands:

- `docker build -t stephengrinder/posts .` - build an image based on the dockerfile in the current directory, tag it as 'stephengrinder/posts'
- `docker run[image id or image tag]` - Create and start a container based on the provided image id or tag
- `docker run -it [image id or image tag][cmd]` - Create and start container, but also override the default command
- `docker ps` - Print out information about all of the running containers
- `docker exec -it [container id][cmd]` - Execute the given command in a running container
- `docker logs [container id]` - Print out logs from the given container

Kubernetes is a tool for running many different containers

- Docker for Mac; preferences, enable Kubernetes
- `kubectl version`
- When you want to use K8s, you should already have all the Docker images ready

## R3 Day 78: 2020-06-06 Saturday

### Running Node.js in a Docker Container

Initial Attempt:

```dockerfile
# base image
FROM alpine
# Install dependencies
RUN npm install
# Set start command
CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```

`docker build .`

Possible errors:

- _npm not found_
  - there is no copy of npm available (npm is not part of the alpine base image)
  - find a different base image (search [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/) for "node")
  - or run a different command to add in npm
  - if you want a certain tag, you could tell it `FROM node:6.14` or `FROM node:alpine` in the Dockerfile
  - "alpine" is a very stripped down version of an image
- _npm WARN saveError ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/package.json'_
  - by default, new container doesn't see files that are on your local filesystem
  - you'll specifically need to tell the container to see files from your hard drive
  - `COPY` command to copy files from local file system to container
  - `COPY ./ ./` (pwd)
- Docker ID is long
  - Let's rebuild using tagging: `docker build -t satinflame/simpleweb .`
  - Now we can run `docker run satinflame/simpleweb`
- Why is the app not showing on `localhost:8080`?
  - By default no outside services can access ports on your computer (incoming requests)
  - We have to set up an explicit port mapping, forward
  - We can only make this change when we run a docker container (fwd requests to my machine at port 8080 to port 8080 on docker)
  - `docker run -p 5000:8080 satinflame/simpleweb`

Cleaning up working directory

- When you run the COPY command in the Dockerfile, let's create a subdirectory so we're not copying files into the base folder
- WORKDIR, once set, any following commands will be executed relative to this folder
- Since we changed Dockerfile, rebuild!
- Now when you run `docker run -it satinflame/simpleweb sh` you'll start in the WORKDIR

Making changes to the local files

- When you run COPY you are making snapshot of the files
- New changes are not automatically reflected
- Need to rebuild--but this means we need to re-copy and re-npm install all items
- Let's split COPY into two steps:
  - `COPY ./package.json ./`
  - `COPY ./ ./`

Our final, awesome Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# base image
FROM node:alpine
# Create work directory
# If not exists, this folder will be created
WORKDIR /usr/app
# Split COPY into two steps to avoid having to npm install each rebuild
COPY ./package.json ./
# Install dependencies
RUN npm install
# Copy local file system to container
# Move this after npm install so npm install doesn't need to be rerun
COPY ./ ./
# Set start command
CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```

### Docker images

- `docker build .` runs build on the Dockerfile
- each build item is a "step"
- each step creates a new intermediate/temporary container
- If rerunning a build that hasn't changed (up to a step), it can use a cache
- put changes as low (last) in the Dockerfile as possible to keep rebuilding fast

Tagging an image

- When building tag in order to reference a name instead of id `<yourDockerId>/<reponame>:<version>`, e.g. `docker build -t stephengrinder/redis:latest .`
- `<reponame>` is what you want to reference it as
- "tag" refers to the version
- `commit -c` - for manually creating

## R3 Day 75: 2020-06-03 Wednesday

### Microservices: Basics of Docker

**More about `-it`**

- Every process inside a Docker (linux) environment has 3 communication channels attached to it:
  1. STDIN - things you type into
  1. STDOUT - output that shows on your console (from the process)
  1. STDERR - similar to STDOUT but specifically for show process errors
- `-it` is really `-i` and `-t`
  - `-i` - attach the terminal to the STDIN when executing this command
  - `-t` - formats input/output so it shows up nicely and allows for autocomplete

**Running a terminal inside your running container**

- `docker exec -it 9320 sh`
- allows for Unix commands like `cd ~/` or `ls`
- if you need to exit and CTRL+C isn't working, try CTRL+D or `exit`
- `sh` is the default command processor (or `bash`)
- containers do not share filesystems by default

**Docker Images**

Creating an Image:

- Setup a dockerfile - plain text config that defines how the container should behave
  - Specify base image
  - Run some command to install additional programs
  - Set the command to run on container startup
  - Base image, Analogy: adding Chrome to a computer with no OS

```dockerfile
# Use existing image (alpine) as base
FROM alpine

# Download and Install depedency
RUN apk add --update redis

# Tell image what to do with in starts as a container
CMD ["redis-server"]
```

`FROM, RUN, CMD` are docker commands used in the `Dockerfile`

## R3 Day 74: 2020-06-02 Tuesday

### Microservices: Basics of Docker

- Image: a snapshot of the filesystem and a start command
- Namespacing: isolating resources per process (or group of processes)
- Control groups (cgroup): manages the RAM, hard disk, network bandwidth, etc needed by the container/per process (linux)
- Docker (for Win/Mac) is a Linux VM, the Linux kernal manages access from containers to computer hardware

`docker run <image name> command`

- Creates _and_ runs a container `docker run` = `docker create` + `docker start`
- Since docker containers have a run command by default, if you add a command, it will _override_ the default run command.
- If we try to execute a command inside a container (`ls` or `echo hi`) that doesn't exist in image's filesystem, we receive an error.
- `docker ps` - show running images
- `docker ps --all` - show any image ever created one machine
- `docker start -a <containerid>` - `-a` (attach), watch it and tell it to output to our console from the container
- By default: `docker run` shows all output; `docker start` does not

Lifecycles

- When a container is exited, it can still be easily restarted
- Images save your start command override; _you cannot override it_
- `docker system prune` - clean existing images
- `docker stop <id>` - gives running processes time to shut down (10s)
- `docker kill <id>` - forces it to stop immediately (such as `ping`)

Seeing what was run:

- → `docker create busybox echo hi there`
- _b895a109c17c51e05967ac463c0d2bb77f82a1be79d2ef0e99ed135dd4cfe02c_
- → `docker start b895` (if you forgot the `-a` flag)
- _b895_
- → `docker logs b895`
- _hi there_

Redis:

- a in-memory data store that's commonly used for web applications
- `docker run redis` - starts Redis server
- `redis-cli` --> need to start it inside the container
- Use `docker exec -it <containerid> <command>` to execute a second command inside a running container (`-it` allows us to provide input to the container)
- e.g.: `docker exec -it 8ca6 redis-cli`

### Microservices: Running services with Docker

- Load balance: randomize which server the incoming request goes to
- Docker container: instance of an image; one container for each service (eg Posts, Comments, Query, Event Bus)
- Kubernetes: a tool for running a bunch of Docker containers together
- K8s cluster: a set of virtual machines (called nodes) managed by master
- K8s master: a program that manages everything in the cluster, reads config file

### Basics of Docker

- `docker run hello-world` - A simple app that shows that docker is running successfully in your environment
- _Docker CLI_ - aka the Docker client
- `docker run <IMGNAME>` creates a container of an image from your local machine or Docker Hub

- Fix type check in moderation
- Turn off moderation service in order to mimick the "pending approval"
- When we turn moderation service back on, the comment will not get approved :(
- How do we deal with missing events and event syncing?
- How do we retroactively enable a new feature in the future?
  1. Sync requests - for first run only
  1. Direct DB access - for first run only
  1. Store events - new service needs access to all events that were emitted in the past

Storing events

- Use event bus, emits event for all services and then stores the event internally in the event bus data store
- New service can determine what needs to be done for tasks
- No extra processing code needs to be written (eg sync and direct db code)

Steps:

1. Every time an event occurs we store it inside an array
2. Add an endpoint to event bus that allows us to retrieve all the events that ever occurred

### Microservices Query Service: Add moderation

Best practice: Query service only listens for `update` events:

- The query service is all about presentation logic
- Does it make sense for a presentation service to understand how to process a very precise update?
- What happens when (in the future) there are 10 ways to update it? (Upvote, add photos, advertised)
- The Comment service is in charge of all business logic around a comment
  - When comment updated (moderated, upvoted, downvoted, etc) Comment service emits one generic event **Comment Updated** to Query service
  - Query service can then take the emitted `data` attrs and copy them

### Microservices blog

Current data flow:

- Get posts, show each post, get the comments for _each_ posts (each making its own request)
- Very inefficient

Proposed: Asynchronous call using an Event bus

- Types of event buses: RabbitMQ, Kafka, NATS
- Adds in a Query service that assembles all of the blogs and comments into an efficient structure
- Listens to any time a post or comment is created
- Posts and Comments services will emit an event when new item created

Emitting events

- Each event should have two properties: `type` (eg 'PostCreated') and `data` (object of new item)

Notes:

- Why do you not need to explicitly install `body-parser` and [why do we need body-parser](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38306569/what-does-body-parser-do-with-express)?
  - To handle HTTP POST request in Express.js version 4 and above, you need to install middleware module called body-parser.
  - body-parser extract the entire body portion of an incoming request stream and exposes it on `req.body`.
  - The middleware was a part of Express.js earlier but now you have to install it separately.
  - This body-parser module parses the JSON, buffer, string and URL encoded data submitted using HTTP POST request. Install body-parser using NPM.
  - _As of April 2019_: in express@4.16.0 the body-parser middleware bundled with express.

There is no technical reason to prefer import over require though: everything that can be done using `require` can be done with `import` and vice versa. In some cases one will be more concise, in another - the other.

### Different ways to define a React component

You have to extend React.Component to create a stateful component which then will need a constructor and you'll be able to use the state.

**Create Component using Class**

```jsx
class Main extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      title: 'Hello React'
    };
  }
  render() {
    return <div>{this.state.title}</div>;
  }
}
```

**Implicit**

```jsx
export default function Foo(props) {
  return <div>My component</div>;
}
```

**Using arrow functions**

Using an arrow function with a class property ensures that the method is always invoked with the component as the value for this, meaning that the manual rebinding here is redundant:

`this.handleUpdateInput = this.handleUpdateInput.bind (this);`

```jsx
export default (details) => {
  // code
};
```

or from Dan Abramov:
"Arrows work just fine if you give them implicit name first."

```jsx
const RenderDetails = (details) => {
  // code
};
export default RenderDetails;
```

[Microservices built with Node, React, Docker and Kubernetes](https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-with-node-js-and-react)

- A **monolith** has _routing, middleware, business logic, and database access_ to implement **all** features of the app
- A single **microservice** has _routing, middleware, business logic, and database access_ to implement **one** features of the app
- Data management between services is a large problem for microservices
- Each service gets its own database
- Services will never, ever reach into another service's database

Communicating between services
(not the same meaning as JavaScript)

- **Sync** - Services communicate with eachother using _direct requests_
  - Service D requests (req/res) directly from Service A, B and C
  - Easy to understand
  - Service D won't need its own database
- **Async** - Services communicate with eachother using _events_
  - Async #1 - uses an **Event bus** - handles little notifications/objects that come from each service
    - Once a service is connected, it can either emit events or receive events
    - Event example: `type: UserQuery, data: {id: 1}`
    - Uncommon; requires the same dependencies as Sync, but has additional downsides
  - Async #2
    - Start by creating a more specific expectation for req/res and what service should do: what is the minimum information needed for the database to return that information?
    - May seem inefficient
    - Services A, B, and C need to tell Service D when there is a related update to the data in database D
    - Service D relies on others to emit an event (that flows into the event bus) in order to know to add information to its db
    - Service D has zero dependencies
    - Extremely fast

> Typed arrays are actually objects, and they don't have access to array methods like push and pop. 🤷‍♀️ But they can help with performance by only allocating the memory space you need. Learning data structures from #freecodecamp! #womenintech #codenewbie R3D56/#100DaysOfCode

VSCode: `Alt + Shift` to [edit multiple lines](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50196011/720970)

### FCC Data Structures

- **Typed Arrays**: allow you to define how much memory you want to give an array.

| Type                | Each element size in bytes |
| ------------------- | -------------------------: |
| `Int8Array`         |                          1 |
| `Uint8Array`        |                          1 |
| `Uint8ClampedArray` |                          1 |
| `Int16Array`        |                          2 |
| `Uint16Array`       |                          2 |
| `Int32Array`        |                          4 |
| `Uint32Array`       |                          4 |
| `Float32Array`      |                          4 |
| `Float64Array`      |                          8 |

Typed arrays do not have some of the methods traditional arrays have such as .pop() or .push(). Typed arrays are type object.

### AMP Notes

Tell the browser your page is AMP using one of two ways:

```html
<html amp ...>
  <html ⚡ ...></html>
</html>
```

- web vitals
- AMP adds tags to HTML
- Supported by Bing and IE
- AMP cache optimizes images for you (for mobile only)
- In the future, "AMP-like" pages might also be given AMP treatment
- Can validate AMP pages with [chrome amp validator plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amp-validator/nmoffdblmcmgeicmolmhobpoocbbmknc/related?hl=en)
- if you add `#development=1` to the end of the URL, errors will log to the console

Types implemented:

- `amp-img`
- `amp-youtube` - Some videos require scripts
- `amp-carousel`
- `amp-sidebar`

Required scripts have to go before the call to the element.

Extra:

- MacOS has a nice emoji shortcut (Ctrl + Cmd + Space) in which you can find and select the lightning bolt

### Docker

**Ports**

- When starting the container, you define which ports you want to bind using the `-p <host-port>:<container-port>` option. The Redis container exposes the service on port 6379. If you wanted to map this port directly on the host, we'd use the option -p 6379:6379.
  `docker run -d --name redisHostPort -p 6379:6379 redis:latest`
- Binding directories (also known as volumes) in Docker is similar to binding ports using the option `-v <host-dir>:<container-dir>`. When a directory is mounted, the files which exist in that directory on the host can be accessed by the container and any data changed/written to the directory inside the container will be stored on the host.
- Docker allows you to use \$PWD as a placeholder for the current directory.
- If we wanted to interact with the container instead of just seeing the output, we'd include the options -ti.

**Phaser.JS**

- 3 ways for Storing State
  1. Create global variables for everything.
  1. Attach important variables to the Scene itself by creating a new property for this from within a Scene method.
  1. Create a `gameState` object and keep track of the state there.
- In order to interact with a GameObject, we need to call the `setInteractive()` method on it. The setInteractive() method tells Phaser to listen in for interactive events on the GameObject.

> Today I'm learning the basics of Phaser.js for game development--including preload, create, and update functions. R3D44/#100DaysOfCode https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-phaser

[Game Development with Phaser.JS](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-phaser/lessons/learn-phaser-basics/exercises/hello-world)

Phaser games are composed of Scenes that we define and pass to Phaser in the config! A Phaser Scene can have any of the following functions:

- `preload()`, where we load in external files (or “assets”) to our game.
- `create()`, where we define the GameObjects that are necessary at the start of our game.
- `update()` where we define animation and interaction in our game (more on this in later exercises!)
- Phaser does its best to call update() 60 times per second, so delta‘s values will normally be around 16.6.

```js
scene: {
  preload, create;
}
```

Note that we are using JavaScript’s property-value shorthand, the code above would be the same if we passed `{ preload: preload, create: create }` to the scene instead.

### Continuous integration

- Travis file: `.travis.yml` indicates to TravisCI what environment we need to run the test on, where do we deploy the app
- Name the docker apps using your docker hub username :) `docker build -t satinflame/lyndanode`
- Create github repo
- Activate in TravisCI
- Trigger a build from dashboard
- You can set ENV vars directly in travis-ci.org

### Other builds

- Swarms, allows you to cluser, manage and schedule containers
- Kubernetes, similar to swarm but is industry standard

> 🛥️ Bonus: Ahoy! Docker containers are named after shipping containers. More nautical analogies can be found in this article on demystifying Docker and Kubernetes. https://apifriends.com/api-management/docker-and-kubernetes/

[Docker for Developers](https://www.lynda.com/Docker-tutorials/Leverage-power-Docker/2211315/2221492-4.html)

### Getting started

- In a project, create a new `Dockerfile` (no extension) and `.dockerignore` (ignores files to place in container)
- In `.dockerignore`:
  ```
  node_modules
  npm-debug.log
  ```
- `Dockerfile` is the blueprint for a container
- VSCode plugin: _ms-azuretools.vscode-docker_
- To build image: `docker build -t folder/backend .` (`-t` = Name and optionally a tag in the ‘name:tag’ format), (`.` runs the [command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/docker/))
- `docker images` - see all images you've created or used
- `docker rmi folder/backend` - rm an image
- `docker run -p 4000:4000 folder/backend` (`-p` is for port)
- while docker is running `docker ps` to list running images (process status)
- `docker stop cc3cc` or `docker start cc3cc` - force stop/start
- `docker pull` / `docker push`

### Develop with Docker

- Goal: Separate the front end and back end on different containers with a volume for data
- `docker-compose.yml` - tells Docker which applications we want to start
- `links` - listed services must run before this; they are defined in the file (eg `mongo`)
- `docker-compose build` to build images in the docker-compose file
- `docker logs cc3cc` if you want to view logs for a particular service
- `docker-compose stop` - turn off all
- `docker run -p 3000:3000 lynda/frontend`

### Fullstack--putting it together

- Created `fullstack` folder. Put `frontend` and `backend` folders in and rename to `client` and `api`, respectively.
- Move the `backend/docker-compose.yml` to main folder
- Update dirs for `backend/Dockerfile`
- Add `version` to docker-compose.yml, to indicate the version of docker-compose
- `links` vs. `depends_on`?
- recommend to start each image separately to prevent crashes:
  1. `docker-compose up -d mongo`
  1. `docker-compose up -d app`
  1. `docker-compose up -d client`

## R3 Day 39: 2020-04-28 Tuesday

### [Getting Started with Google Kubernetes Engine](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-kubernetes-engine/lecture/Ad1z3/what-are-containers)

Labs: [Introduction to Containers and Docker](https://github.com/ScottyVG/public-org/blob/master/google-cloud-kubernetes/google-cloud-training.org)

### Introduction to Containers

History of servers

- Dedicated Server -- Maintain the hardware (physical servers), OS Kernal, Dependencies and Application code.
- Virtual Machine -- Abstract the hardware, maintain Kernal, Dependencies and Application code.
- Container -- Abstract the hardware, virtualize the Kernal (decoupled), maintain Dependencies and Application code.

- CGroup (consistency group) - allows you to manage these containers and keep them consistent _2006_
- Docker - you can only edit the top layer "container layer" _2013_

### Introduction to Docker

IRL: you push and pull images from a registry

What are advantages of containers versus virtual machines?

- They share parts of the OS, but not common dependencies, so they start fast and can run anywhere with the same kernel.

Which types of actions can you perform in a container Dockerfile?

- CMD - what command to run in the container
- FROM - creates a layer a Docker image

What is the default hostname to publish a Docker image to the Google Registry?

- gcr.io

### Clusters, Nodes, and Pods

**Kubernetes** -- an open-source orchestrator for a container environment, it manages and delegates jobs

- Users
- Master cluster server - controls jobs, scheduling, etcd (a cluster is a set of computers that works as an instance that manages nodes); masters manage jobs by scheduling jobs on nodes based on loads (move to nodes with free-space or move jobs away from nodes that pulling a lot of resources), Master runs K8s
- Nodes (Kubelets, a K8s engine)
- Pod -- analogous to "VM", they share networking and storage separate from the node, yaml config (containers, ports), can have redundant pods as failsafes

### Services, Labels, and Selectors

- Service assigns a fixed IP to your pod replicas, acts as communication beween pods, acts as a load balancer, defined in yaml
- Labels -- metadata you can assign to any API object and represent identity, used for filtering/searching pods; e.g.

  ```js
  Pod1;
  App: MyApp;
  Phase: prod;
  Role: FE;

  Pod2;
  App: MyApp;
  Phase: test;
  Role: BE;
  ```

### Volumes

- Docker provides data storage for containers, volumes do not share data
- K8s volume allow containers in pods to share data and be stateful
- Volume -- a directory

Why use Kubernetes (i.e. what benefit does it provide to containers?)

- It provides a set of APIs that you can use to deploy containers on a set of nodes.

What does a pod specify?

- A set of containers sharing networking and storage.

Which component do you use to send requests to API servers on masters to configure the cluster?

- `kubectl`

### Deployments and Rolling Updates

- Deployments rely on replicate sets to manage and run pods
- allow you to name a set of pods, and a number, to make sure pods run evenly
- if one node (pod) is unhealthy, the deployment will spin up a new pod to keep the number correct
- rolling updates allow you to gradually update from one image version to another, moves one pod from one ReplicaSet to another ReplicaSet with a newer image version until they've all been moved

### Canary and Blue-Green Deployments

- Canary deployment relies on a service to load-balance the traffic to primary pods based on label selectors
- Blue-Green deployment uses the service label selector to switch all traffic from one deployment to another

### Lab: Deploying to Kubernetes

What is the purpose of the ReplicaSet?

- To create a desired number of pods.

When are rolling deployments triggered?

- If the deployment’s pod template changes.

How does Kubernetes choose instances in the second deployment of a canary deployment?

- The service points to instances in both deployments with a common selector.

### Creating a Continuous Delivery Pipeline

Deploying a continuous delivery pipeline enables you to build, stage, test, and deploy your application, using automated triggers and manual approvals. (e.g. Spinnaker or Jenkins)

- Build steps - analogous to running commands in a script (Spinnaker)
- Pushing to a certain branch may update a dev environment or later prod (Jenkins)
- Spinnaker and Jenkins are deployed as K8s applications, they are not stand-alone services

Why is it useful to set up continuous delivery with Kubernetes?

- Continuous delivery is one of the main advantages of containers because containers are so portable.

Which 3 deployments are used in our instance of Kubernetes continuous delivery?

- Development, canary, and production.

Which of the following best describes why we used Jenkins for continous delivery with Kubernetes?

- You can use any tool, but it’s good to try one that’s well documented in a controlled environment first.

> Reviewing HTTP response statuses sent in APIs. It seems that there's not even agreement over the correct status for GET for an element that does not exist in DB (404/204/null object/500?), but I now have plenty of references! R3D36/#100DaysOfCode
> https://nordicapis.com/best-practices-api-error-handling

- [HTTP/1.1: Status Code Definitions](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html)
- _"It’s in the 4XX range, so you know the problem was on the client side..."_ [Best Practices for API Error Handling](https://nordicapis.com/best-practices-api-error-handling/)
- [IETF publication RFC 7807](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807)
- [IETF List of Responses](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.3.5)

Example of [404 response](https://gitlab.com/pragmaticreviews/node-mocha-chai/-/blob/master/index.js):

```js
// GET (BY ID)
app.get('/api/tasks/:id', (request, response) => {
  const taskId = request.params.id;
  const task = tasks.find((task) => task.id === parseInt(taskId));
  if (!task)
    return response
      .status(404)
      .send('The task with the provided ID does not exist.');
  response.send(task);
});
```

Recommended example (ref RFC 7807) from [Best Practices for REST API Error Handling](https://www.baeldung.com/rest-api-error-handling-best-practices):

This schema is composed of five parts:

1. **type** — A URI identifier that categorizes the error
1. **title** — A brief, human-readable message about the error
1. **status** — The HTTP response code (optional)
1. **detail** — A human-readable explanation of the error
1. **instance** — A URI that identifies the specific occurrence of the error

```json
{
  "type": "/errors/incorrect-user-pass",
  "title": "Incorrect username or password.",
  "status": 403,
  "detail": "Authentication failed due to incorrect username or password.",
  "instance": "/login/log/abc123"
}
```

For example, in HTML, a problem could be embedded by [encapsulating JSON in a script tag (pg 16)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807):

```json
<script type="application/problem+json">
  {
    "type": "https://example.com/probs/out-of-credit",
    "title": "You do not have enough credit.",
    "detail": "Your current balance is 30, but that costs 50.",
    "instance": "/account/12345/msgs/abc",
    "balance": 30,
    "accounts": ["/account/12345",
                "/account/67890"]
  }
</script>
```

Example from [twitter API](https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/mentions_timeline.json):

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Sorry, that page does not exist",
      "code": 34
    }
  ]
}
```

Example from facebook API:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "An active access token must be used to query information about the current user.",
    "type": "OAuthException",
    "code": 2500,
    "fbtrace_id": "A6S6sVDcfVJd7p7vcOABR0d"
  }
}
```

Example from Twilio API:

```json
{
  "code": 21211,
  "message": "The 'To' number 5551234567 is not a valid phone number.",
  "more_info": "https://www.twilio.com/docs/errors/21211",
  "status": 400

- [.stylelintrc.json WIP](https://github.com/virtual/shoreline/blob/master/.stylelintrc.json)
- packages:

```json
"stylelint": "^13.3.3",
"stylelint-config-rational-order": "^0.1.2",
"stylelint-declaration-block-no-ignored-properties": "^2.3.0",
"stylelint-order": "^4.0.0",
```

- All .scss comments should be on their own line to prevent bugs
- `npx stylelint source/_assets/sass/FILE.scss --fix` to autofix

**Stylelint tips:**

Glad you're learning to use stylelint! The 50+ rules that [limit language features](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/rules/list#limit-language-features) are often overlooked. They are `*-pattern`, `*-blacklist`, `*-whitelist` and `*-max-*` rules that you can use to enforce non-stylistic conventions in your CSS.

```json
{
  "declaration-no-important": true,
  "media-feature-name-whitelist": ["min-width"],
  "selector-class-pattern": "^[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]+$",
  "selector-max-id": 0,
  "unit-whitelist": ["rem"]
}
```

To enforce `rem` units, `min-width` media queries, camelCase selectors and so on.

### IBM Practitioner

Restless reinvention

- _“The last best experience that anyone has anywhere, becomes the minimum expectation for the experience they want everywhere.”_ - Bridget Van Kralingen
- **restless reinvention**
  a principle of Enterprise Design Thinking that represents active continuous testing and learning in order to improve the solution to a problem
- Visualize your ideas, so that your team and users can understand them clearly. It does need to communicate the idea enough for someone else to understand it and give you feedback.
- The next time you have a new idea to share with your team, before you tell them about it, draw it on paper. Think about how a diagram or visual representation might convey something that words couldn’t.
- Ideate!
- Prompts like “...on the moon” automatically trigger non-obvious ideas. And that’s how you get to something no one else does yet.Try thinking of your users’ problem in a different context, like “without modern technology,” or “in the year 3019.”
- Take risks: Let’s talk about failure

Include a variety of voices

- Enterprise Design Thinking asks that you collaborate as a whole team to get the job done.
- **Diverse Empowered Teams**
  an Enterprise Design Thinking Principle that represents that a group of people with varied perspectives more successfully make decisions together and work toward shared goals
- Ideate
- Cluster like ideas
- Build off eachother's ideas
- Come to some alignment on a path forward
- Build alignment across your team, **alignment** a state of agreement and understanding on a group decision that includes follow-through on that decision
  - Next time you’re in a meeting where the conversation spins in circles, ask everyone to grab something to write with, visualize their thoughts, and then take turns sharing.
  - Next time you’re in a meeting where only one or two people share their opinion, hold a silent and anonymous voting session to expose everyone’s viewpoints.
- Start sharing stories
- **Playbacks**
  an Enterprise Design Thinking Key, story-based presentations that bring stakeholders and whole teams together in a safe space to exchange feedback
- Alignment:
  - Starting a new project or initiative. Answer questions like: _Who will be the users and stakeholders? What experience are we trying to improve and why?_
  - Deciding as a team on a future experience for your users. Answer questions like: _What do we think our users need to be successful? How are we going to serve those needs?_
  - Reviewing progress as you deliver. Answer questions like: _Do we successfully deliver value to our users? Are we still aligned as a team?_

Planning

- In design thinking, to solve for an actual need that exists in the world, you must take the time to write clear problem statements around your intent: What problem are you solving, for whom, and why?

## R3 Day 30: 2020-04-19 Sunday

> Spent the day learning https://istanbul.js.org/ and code coverage. What is it? The measure (%) of how much code is executed with a given operation. (Goal: 100% coverage!) R3D30/#100DaysOfCode
>
> - Executed statements
> - Branches
> - Called, defined functions
> - Executed lines

> 🎵 Bonus: why do you run the Istanbul test coverage library with `nyc` instead of `istanbul`? It's a reference to the song "Istanbul (not Constantinople)" from They Might Be Giants! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo0X77OBJUg

### What is code coverage?

- Code coverage: the measure of how much code is executed with a given operation (%)
- Four types, the proportion of:
  1. Executed statements
  1. Branches
  1. Called, defined functions
  1. Executed lines
- The percentages will often be pretty close to each other, but you can have 100% line execution but miss out on some branches.
- Reports also show uncovered lines, which are not covered by any test

**Statements**--perform an action in code

- can be many lines
- consists of a group of keywords
- examples:
  - content in an `if... else` block
  - declaring a variable `const...`
  - what executes in a `while` loop

**Branches**--each statement within a conditional

- include conditions, logical ors, ands and not (`||, &&, !`), ternary operator
- examples:

```js
if (condition) {
  statement1(); //branch 1
} else {
  statement2(); //branch 2
  statement3(); //branch 2
}
```

**Function**--a function that is never called

**Line**--a line that is never executed

### How do we implement code coverage?

Code coverage libraries:

- Blanket.js - no longer maintained
- JSCoverage - no longer maintained
- [Istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/): active and still preferred in 2020
  - 🎵 Music reference, run with `nyc` as a ref to [Istanbul (not Constantinople) - They Might Be Giants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo0X77OBJUg)
  - Reports
    - Text
    - HTML
    - LCOV (a code coverage standard)

Install:

- add `nyc` to dev dependencies: `npm install nyc -D`
- add coverage to package.json: `"coverage": "cross-env DEBUG=nadia:* nyc --reporter=text --reporter=html mocha"`
- Give test runner as argument (mocha): `npm run -s coverage`
- Ignore coverage files from .eslintignore

Functional Testing

- Based on business requirements
- Describes what a function does, not how
- Libraries:
  - Phantom.js (Casper.js)
  - Selenium WebDriver (Nightwatch, webdriver io)
  - SuperAgent (Chai HTTP)

Example user stories for Functional Testing:

As a user, I want to:

- See a reservation form
- Book a table.
- Submit a valid reservation
- Be thanked upon success.
- Submit an invalid reservation
- Be informed that there's a problem.

Installing Chai HTTP:
`npm install chai-http -D`

**Chai docs on using .get(), end**

Because the end function is passed a callback, assertions are run asynchronously. Therefore, a mechanism must be used to notify the testing framework that the callback has completed. Otherwise, the test will pass before the assertions are checked.

For example, in the Mocha test framework, this is accomplished using the done callback, which signal that the callback has completed, and the assertions can be verified:

```js
it('fails, as expected', function (done) {
  // <= Pass in done callback
  chai
    .request('http://localhost:8080')
    .get('/')
    .end(function (err, res) {
      expect(res).to.have.status(123);
      done(); // <= Call done to signal callback end
    });
});

it('succeeds silently!', function () {
  // <= No done callback
  chai
    .request('http://localhost:8080')
    .get('/')
    .end(function (err, res) {
      expect(res).to.have.status(123); // <= Test completes before this runs
    });
});
```

When done is passed in, Mocha will wait until the call to done(), or until the timeout expires. done also accepts an error parameter when signaling completion.

**"100% Test" coverage:**

- Does not mean that your application is bug free.
- Does not mean that you wrote good tests, it just means that your tests didn't fail.
- Tests could not be properly isolated so unexpected behavior could still occur.
- Does not deliver new functionality
- Not a substitute for peer code review.

Open source continuous integration:

- Buildbot
- Jenkins
- Strider CD

Continuous Integration as a Service:

- CircleCI
- Gitlab
- TravisCI
- Heroku (I think?)

CI Features to look for:

- Matches your prod environment
- Easy to configure and use
- Scalable
- Integrates with your workflow

### Establishing Code Standards

- try a eslint config
- jsdocs to require good docs, require-jsdoc, valid-jsdoc
- Mocha rules: eslint-program-mocha

## R3 Day 29: 2020-04-18 Saturday

> Learning how to test code and watch if it successfully creates entries & which actions are performed. Test doubles, stubs, spies & mocks. Not understanding everything... but more info can also be found in this 800+ page book! http://xunitpatterns.com 🙈 R3D29/#100DaysOfCode

- Test Doubles
  - A replacement for any component of executable code (module or method)
  - Simplified
  - May be hard-coded
  - Isolated, consistent, and fast
  - Sinon.js is one library, sinon-chai is a module we can use with Chai for readability: `npm install sinon@2 sinon-chai -D`
- A test stub verifies indirect inputs by providing a controlled response.
- A test spy records indirect outputs by reporting on how the request was made for later verification.
- A mock object verifies indirect outputs by setting up expectations and throwing an exception if it's used unexpectedly.
- A fake object just runs faster with less functionality.
- And a dummy object specifies values used for testing.
- xunitpatterns.com and martinfowler.com for more info

Overriding dependencies

- Testing dependencies is integration, not unit testing
- 3 main dependency maniuplation libaries:
  1. Mockery (easiest, shows warnings)
  1. Proxyquire (offers more granular control): `npm install proxyquire -D`
  1. Rewire (can override modules, but doesn't support es6 or transpilers like Babel)
- Stub update in package.json: `"test": "cross-env DEBUG=nadia:* mocha"`

**Process of Stubbing a Custom Response**

- Replicate how the method responds:
  - Is it returning a value, throwing an exception, or is it a promise that resolves or rejects?
  - Once you know how the response will be made you'll need to replicate what is being returned. The goal should be to match the structure.
  - If it returns an integer, the stub will need to return an integer, and so forth.
- The easiest way to discover this is to console.log the actual response if the API documentation isn't available or you're not sure.

Example: testing a module that updates the database:

- How can we use a wrapped stub?
- In our application, the best target will be create, which uses save to insert a reservations record into the database. Create uses that response to return an ID.
- To do this, we'll wrap the database, replace the run method, and return a resolved promise that has the correct structure.

**Observing interactions with Spies**

- spies record information about function calls
- How are we going to use spies in our application?
  -It'd be useful to check how the validator was called when creating a reservation.
- The validator should only be called once. When called through create, it should be called with a transformed reservation.

**Sinon Mocks**

- Control how a unit of code is being used
- Gives no responses
- Tests how many times called
- Tests with which arguments
- Example, ensure db is only called once when saving

Book ref: xUnit Test Patterns: Refactoring Test Code by Gerard Meszaros

## R3 Day 28: 2020-04-17 Friday

> Back to more testing with Mocha and Chai. Set up example tests for unit tests, callbacks and promises. Mocha doesn't use arrow functions in order to keep the correct binding for `this`. R3D28/#100DaysOfCode https://www.lynda.com/Node-js-tutorials/Node-js-Testing-Code-Quality/587672-2.html

- Unit test:
  - Setup test with describe
  - Arrow functions in mocha are discouraged because they break the binding to `this`
  - Setup suite of tests w/ context
  - mocha is not recursive by default, need to pass recursive flag `npm test -- --recursive`
  - you can add `test/mocha.opts` (deprecated) to override default setting; add to file: `--recursive` or see [.mocharc.json](https://boneskull.com/mocha-v6/)
- Testing asynchronous code
  - Add a callback to `it`, usually called `done()`
- Testing promises
  - return the promise
  - then put the assertion in `.then` or `.catch`
  - do not use callback (do not use `done()`)

```js
describe('Reservation Suite', function () {
  context('Date and Time Combination', function () {
    it('should return a ISO 8601 date and time with valid input', function () {
      const date = '2020/04/17';
      const time = '04:53 PM';

      Reservation.combineDateTime(date, time).should.equal(
        '2020-04-17T16:53:00.000Z'
      );
    });
  });
});

## R3 Day 26: 2020-04-15 Wednesday

> Today I customized ESLint to keep code tidy and standardized within a project.
>
> You can also customize your own config and add it to npm for others to use as a dependency—as Google and Airbnb have done for their teams. Neat! R3D26/#100DaysOfCode https://medium.com/@natterstefan/how-to-create-your-own-shared-eslint-prettier-and-stylelint-configuration-3930dd764de3

### Validate correctness using Unit Testing

Node.js Testing frameworks:

- AVA
- Jasmine
- Jest
- mocha -- oldest and most used; does not include assertsions, but supports plugins (Chai)
- tape

Assertion Libraries (that work with any testing framework):

- Assert (built into Node.js)
- Chai - can be used for Node.js and browser testing
  - assert: TDD-style
  - expect/should: BDD-style
- code - simplified expect functions from Chai only
- should.js

### Installing

- `npm install mocha chai -D`
- add `"test": "mocha"` to scripts
- add ESLint env vars for mocha globals--add `test/.eslintrc.js`

```js
module.exports = {
  env: {
    mocha: true
  },
  rules: {
    'no-unused-vars': ['error', { varsIgnorePattern: 'should|expect' }]
  }
};
```

ESLint Configs

- You can export setup to npm so that others can use it
- View a [list of available eslint configs](https://github.com/dustinspecker/awesome-eslint)
- A sharable config can extend another
- Use `git+ssh`
- [How to create your own shared esLint, prettier and stylelint configuration](https://medium.com/@natterstefan/how-to-create-your-own-shared-eslint-prettier-and-stylelint-configuration-3930dd764de3)
- you can ignore certain directories with `.eslintignore`, good for third-party code, contributed files, etc
- Try using ESLint autofix errors from command palette

## R3 Day 25: 2020-04-14 Tuesday

> Learning how to set up and configure EditorConfig and ESLint in order to maintain consistent coding standards in my projects! R3D25/#100DaysOfCode https://www.lynda.com/Node-js-tutorials/Node-js-Testing-Code-Quality/587672-2.html

Linter:

- `root: true` only in root
- built-in checker: `node --check jsfile.js`
- JSLint, JSHint, and ESLint (most popular)

ESLint

- don't install globally, package antipattern
- `npm install eslint -D`
- add `"eslint": "eslint",` to the scripts in package.json due to the placement of eslint
- `npm run eslint` or `npm run eslint .`
- need to configure ESLint `eslint init`
- don't put ESLint configs in package.json, use .eslintrc.js instead
- try putting flags before `eslint`, `npm run -h eslint`
- check a file `npm run -s eslint file.js`

## R3 Day 24: 2020-04-13 Monday

> Following along on a @lynda course from @FluxSauce on Node.js testing. Great info on testing libraries vs. assertion libraries, TDD vs. BDD, and soon will be digging into setting up better linting tools! R3D24/#100DaysOfCode https://www.lynda.com/Node-js-tutorials/Node-js-Testing-Code-Quality/587672-2.html

[Node.js: Testing and Code Quality - Jon Peck](https://www.lynda.com/Node-js-tutorials/Node-js-Testing-Code-Quality/587672-2.html)

- Quality code is deficiency free
  - Useful: What does it do, can it be extended to work for similar operations?
  - Maintainable
    - Can you maintain the code?
    - Can someone else maintain it without help?
    - Can someone else read the code and understand the design and intent?
- Code standards are the easiest way to improve code quality
  - Use good conventions: spacing, whitespace, naming
  - Use linters to check for good code standards
  - Run lint before peer review

Different types of testing:

- **Unit testing**: the smallest testable part of an application, ie a function
  - tests an isolated unit via API
  - safe to run repeatedly
  - fast
  - validates an assertion, returns true or false
  - simulate dependencies
  - do not test third-party code
- **Integrations testing**: builds upon unit tests, combines and tests resulting combinations (APIs, UIs, results)
  - more complex
  - harder to maintain
  - checks more steps (register success, validation, etc)
- **Functional testing**: tests how the system works together, against the requirements
  - focus is on the result, not the code
  - slower to execute
  - tests user interface, eg. click button, enter input, see UI message
- **System testing**: tests the whole system, security issues, usability, etc
  - any test that requires the whole system to be running
- **Regression testing**: "regression"-software bug

TDD vs BDD

- TDD: terminology about testing
  - describes when something works and when it doesn't
  - too literal
  - can lead to overly specific tests
- BDD: terminology about behavior examples
  - describe how and why with examples
  - acceptance criteria as a scenario:
    - **given** some initial context (the givens)
    - **when** an event occurs
    - **then** ensures some outcomes
  - `describe/context` - creates a group of specifications (tests)
  - `specify/it` - create a specification, test, or test-spec

## R3 Day 23: 2020-04-12 Sunday

> Happy Easter! 🌼 Taking a step back from freeCodeCamp projects to learn JavaScript testing a bit more thoroughly on Lynda. Are there any recommendations for good walkthroughs on TDD/BDD (Test/Behavior-Driven Development) using Node.js/ChaiJS? R3D23/#100DaysOfCode

### Reviewing Testing

[Node.js: Testing and Code Quality - Jon Peck](https://www.lynda.com/Node-js-tutorials/Node-js-Testing-Code-Quality/587672-2.html)

Notes:

TDD General Notes:

- **Mocha** is the _testing_ library that allows us to run tests, and **Chai** is an _assertion_ library that contains some helpful functions that we’ll use to verify our test results.
- `describe` is used to group individual tests
- In TDD, you write your unit test first, watch it fail, and then implement code changes until the test passes.

[Five steps to TDD](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/5-steps-of-test-driven-development/) (also known as Red-Green-Refactoring):

1. Read, understand, and process the feature or bug request.
1. Translate the requirement by writing a unit test. If you have hot reloading set up, the unit test will run and fail as no code is implemented yet.
1. Write and implement the code that fulfills the requirement. Run all tests and they should pass, if not repeat this step.
1. Clean up your code by refactoring.
1. Rinse, lather and repeat.

Questions:

- What is BDD? I keep seeing it.
  _In TDD (Test Driven Development), the test is written to check the implementation of functionality, but as the code evolves, tests can give false results. BDD (Behavior Driven Development) is also a test-first approach, but differs by testing the actual behavior of the system from the end users perspective._

#### Notes

- **Design thinking** is the mindset that aims to improve the situation of people through the experiences they have. If you’re interested in solving problems for people, then you can practice design thinking.
- **The Loops** - Understand the present and envision the future in a continuous cycle of:
  - _observing_: Immerse yourself in the real world with design research. Interview users, watch them work, and test your ideas with the people who matter most to inform your decision-making and understanding.
  - _reflecting_: Come together and look within to synchronize your movements, synthesize what you’ve learned, and share your “aha” moments with each other. Decide together and move forward with confidence.
  - _making_: Give concrete form to abstract ideas. **The earlier you make the faster you learn.** Put your ideas out there before they’re complete and improve them as you go.
- **Enterprise Design Thinking** -
  a tailor-made approach for large, distributed teams to help them quickly deliver human-centered outcomes to the market
- **Principles**
  1. A focus on user outcomes
  1. Restless reinvention
  1. Diverse Empowered Teams
- **Keys**
  1. 🔺 Hills: Hills are statements of intent written as user enablements. They follow a format of Who, What, and Wow.
  1. 🔲 Playbacks: Playbacks are story-based presentations that share insights, ideas, and updates to a user experience.
  1. \*️⃣ Sponsor Users: Sponsor Users are external clients, future clients, or end users that represent your target user, who regularly contribute domain expertise to your team.

> Building the first project for @freecodecamp's security challenges. Added controller functions to process input (32mi) and calc output (51.5kg). @getpostman helps to debug. Love these projects, they really make things click! R3D15/#100DaysOfCode
> https://virtual-fcc-mi-convert.glitch.me

"Controllers" — functions that separate out the code to route requests from the code that actually processes requests.

Since I always forget the MVC setup:

- **Models** are the heart of any JavaScript application, containing the interactive data as well as a large part of the logic surrounding it: conversions, validations, computed properties, and access control.
- **Routes** to forward the supported requests (and any information encoded in request URLs) to the appropriate controller functions.
- **Controller** functions to get the requested data from the models, create an HTML page displaying the data, and return it to the user to view in the browser.
- **Views** (templates) used by the controllers to render the data.

There are so many issues and gotchas with this chapter outlined in a myriad of forum posts and GitHub issues.

Time for me to leave this challenge and hope when I get back to it, it's been given some TLC. I tried a GitHub PR for the page title issues, but it was rejected.

Serialization of a User Object

_To serialize an object means to convert its contents into a small key essentially that can then be deserialized into the original object. This is what allows us to know whos communicated with the server without having to send the authentication data like username and password at each request for a new page._

Authentication Strategies

_A strategy is a way of authenticating a user._

      p.
        Pug is a terse and simple templating language with a
        strong focus on performance and powerful features.
```

### Passport

_It's time to set up Passport so we can finally start allowing a user to register or login to an account! In addition to Passport, we will use Express-session to handle sessions. Using this middleware saves the session id as a cookie in the client and allows us to access the session data using that id on the server. This way we keep personal account information out of the cookie used by the client to verify to our server they are authenticated and just keep the key to access the data stored on the server._

```js
const session = require('express-session');
const passport = require('passport');

// ...

app.use(
  session({
    secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,
    resave: true,
    saveUninitialized: true
  })
);

// passport. initialize() is a middle-ware that initialises Passport. Middlewares are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle
app.use(passport.initialize());

// passport.session() acts as a middleware to alter the req object and change the 'user' value that is currently the session id (from the client cookie) into the true deserialized user object.
// `app.use(passport.session());` is equivalent to `app.use(passport.authenticate('session'));`
app.use(passport.session());
```

### Applied InfoSec Challenges

#### HelmetJS

_HelmetJS is a type of middleware for Express-based applications that automatically sets HTTP headers to prevent sensitive information from unintentionally being passed between the server and client. While HelmetJS does not account for all situations, it does include support for common ones like Content Security Policy, XSS Filtering, and HTTP Strict Transport Security, among others. HelmetJS can be installed on an Express project from npm, after which each layer of protection can be configured to best fit the project._

- `contentSecurityPolicy` for setting Content Security Policy
- `dnsPrefetchControl` controls browser DNS prefetching
- `frameguard` to prevent clickjacking
- `hidePoweredBy` to remove the X-Powered-By header
- `hsts` for HTTP Strict Transport Security
- `ieNoOpen` sets X-Download-Options for IE8+
- `noSniff` to keep clients from sniffing the MIME type
- `referrerPolicy` to hide the Referer header
- `xssFilter` adds some small XSS protections

#### BCrypt

_BCrypt hashes are very secure. A hash is basically a fingerprint of the original data- always unique. This is accomplished by feeding the original data into an algorithm and returning a fixed length result. To further complicate this process and make it more secure, you can also salt your hash. Salting your hash involves adding random data to the original data before the hashing process which makes it even harder to crack the hash._

_BCrypt hashes will always looks like `$2a$13$ZyprE5MRw2Q3WpNOGZWGbeG7ADUre1Q8QO.uUUtcbqloU0yvzavOm` which does have a structure. The first small bit of data `$2a` is defining what kind of hash algorithm was used. The next portion `$13` defines the cost. Cost is about how much power it takes to compute the hash. It is on a logarithmic scale of 2^cost and determines how many times the data is put through the hashing algorithm. For example, at a cost of 10 you are able to hash 10 passwords a second on an average computer, however at a cost of 15 it takes 3 seconds per hash... and to take it further, at a cost of 31 it would takes multiple days to complete a hash. A cost of 12 is considered very secure at this time. The last portion of your hash `$ZyprE5MRw2Q3WpNOGZWGbeG7ADUre1Q8QO.uUUtcbqloU0yvzavOm`, looks like one large string of numbers, periods, and letters but it is actually two separate pieces of information. The first 22 characters is the salt in plain text, and the rest is the hashed password!_

> @FrontendMasters
> CSS In-Depth. https://codepen.io/virtual/pen/abORwjw?editors=0100

### Psuedo-selectors

Selectors that match based on the current state of the UI

`:valid`

`:invalid` (out of range and/or unmatched step value)

`:required`

`:optional`

`:in-range`

`:out-of-range` (out of range, ignores step)

`:user-invalid` Similar to on blur

>
> Reviewing selectors, specificity, and gotchas with
> @estelle
> —you know, for the next CSS trivia night. Winking face

### Selectors

Selector: "The part that comes before the declaration block"

Pseudo-classes have the same selector weight as classes (0 - 1 - 0)

### Attribute selectors

`[attribute]` Has the attribute (e.g. [type])

`[attribute='value']` Equal to the exact value only

`[attribute~='value']` Includes the full word 'value'

`[attribute|='en']` Equal to "en" specifically or "en-" followed by anything

`[attribute^='val']` Starts with (e.g. 'https:')

`[attribute$='lue']` Ends with (e.g. ".pdf")

`[attribute*='alu']` Has anywhere

➡️ Sequential:

- low risk
- familiar application and implementation
- design is well understood

🔄 Iterative:

- high risk
- unfamiliar application
- complex/hard to understand

❓ Determine problem definition: ask what the problem is using clear language. The "problem definition" should not include a solution or technical jargon.

### [Full-Stack Developer: The Definitive Guide](https://medium.com/coderbyte/a-guide-to-becoming-a-full-stack-developer-in-2017-5c3c08a1600c)

Reviewing which parts I need to work more on.

#### 1. HTML/CSS

_Almost every single program, whether online or in-person, that is teaching you how to be a web developer will start with HTML and CSS because they are the building blocks of the web. Simply put, HTML allows you to add content to a website and CSS is what allows you to style your content. The following topics related to HTML/CSS come up often in interviews and on the actual job when you’re working:_

- [x] Semantic HTML.
- [x] Be able to explain the CSS Box Model.
- [x] Benefits of CSS preprocessors.
- [x] CSS Media Queries to target different devices and write responsive CSS.
- [x] Bootstrap

#### 2. JavaScript

_The JavaScript language is growing more popular every year and new libraries, frameworks, and tools are constantly being released. Based on the Stack Overflow 2016 Developer Survey, JavaScript is the most popular language in both Full-Stack, Front-end, and Back-end Development. It’s the only language that runs natively in the browser, and can double up as a server-side language as well (as you’ll see below with Node.js). Below are some topics you need to understand as a Full-Stack Developer:_

- [x] Understand how to work with the DOM. Also know what JSON is and how to manipulate it.
- [ ] Important language features such as functional composition, prototypal inheritance, closures, event delegation, scope, higher-order functions.
- [ ] Asynchronous control flow, promises, and callbacks.
- [ ] Learn how to properly structure your code and modularize parts of it, things like webpack, browserify, or build tools like gulp will definitely be helpful to know.
- [x] Know how to use at least one popular framework. (React)
- [x] jQuery
- [ ] Some knowledge on testing frameworks and why they’re important.
- [x] Learn about some important new ES6 features (optional).

#### 3. Back-End Language

_Once you feel you’ve gotten a good grasp on HTML/CSS and JavaScript, you’ll want to move on to a back-end language that will handle things like database operations, user authentication, and application logic. All online programs and bootcamps usually focus on a specific back-end language, and in reality in doesn’t matter which one you learn so much as long as you understand what is going on and you learn the nuances of your chosen language. You’ll get a ton of different responses if you ask someone which back-end language is the best to learn, so below I’ve listed a few popular combinations. An important note: whichever you decide to learn, just stick with it and learn as much as you can about it — there are jobs out there for all the languages listed below._

- [x] Node.js: This is a great option because Node.js is itself just a JavaScript environment which means you don’t need to learn a new language. This is a big reason why a lot of online programs and bootcamps choose to teach Node.js. The most popular framework you’d most likely learn to aid you in developing web applications is Express.
- [ ] Ruby: Some popular frameworks for developing in Ruby are Rails and Sinatra. Plenty of programs teach Ruby as a first back-end language.
- [ ] Python: Some popular frameworks for developing in Python are Django and Flask.
- [ ] Java: The Java language isn’t taught so much these days when it comes to Full-Stack Web Development, but some companies do use Java as their back-end and it is still a very in-demand language (see image above).
- [x] PHP: PHP is rarely taught in programs these days, but just like with Java, it is still very in-demand and it is a cornerstone of the web today.

#### 4. Databases & Web Storage

_When learning to build web applications, at some point you’ll probably want to store data somewhere and then access it later. You should have a good grasp on the following topics related to databases and storage._

- [x] Understand the benefits of relational data, e.g. SQL.
- [x] Learn about NoSQL databases, e.g. MongoDB.
- [x] Understand which would be better in certain situations.
- [x] Know how to connect a database with your chosen back-end language (e.g. Node.js + MongoDB).
- [ ] Understand the benefits of in-memory data stores like Redis or memcached.
- [x] Web storage to store sessions, cookies, and cached data in the browser.
- [ ] Scaling databases, ACID, and ORM (all optional).

#### 5. HTTP & REST

_HTTP is a stateless application protocol on the Internet — it’s what allows clients to communicate with servers (e.g. your JavaScript code can make an AJAX request to some back-end code you have running on a server which will happen via HTTP)._

- [x] What is REST and why is it important in regards to the HTTP protocol and web applications.
- [x] Best practices for designing a RESTful API. POST/GET requests.
- [x] Learning how to use Chrome DevTools can be extremely helpful.
- [x] What are SSL Certificates.
- [ ] HTTP/2 & SPDY (optional).
- [ ] WebSockets, Web Workers, and Service Workers (all optional).

#### 6. Web Application Architecture

_Once you think you have a grasp on HTML/CSS, JavaScript, back-end programming, databases, and HTTP/REST, then comes the tricky part. At this point if you want to create a somewhat complex web application, you’ll need to know how to structure your code, how to separate your files, where to host your large media files, how to structure the data in your database, where to perform certain computational tasks (client-side vs server-side), and much more._

_There are best practices that you can read about online on, but the best way to actually learn about application architecture is by working on a large application yourself that contains several moving parts — or even better, working on a team and together developing a somewhat large/complex application._

_This is why, for example, someone with 7+ years of experience may not necessarily know CSS or JavaScript better than someone with 2 years of experience, but over all of those years they’ve presumably worked with all sorts of different applications and websites and have learned how to architect and design applications (among learning other important things) to be most efficient and can see the “big picture” when it comes to development. Below are some things you can read that will help you learn how to architect your web applications efficiently:_

- [x] Learn about common platforms as a service, e.g. Heroku and AWS. Heroku allows you to easily upload your code and have an application up and running with very little configuration or server maintenance and AWS offers dozens of products and services to help with storage, video processing, load balancing, and much more.
- [ ] Performance optimization for applications and modern browsers.
- [ ] Some opinions on what a web application architecture should include.
- [ ] Designing Web Applications by Microsoft.
- [x] MVC.
- [x] Most importantly though you should try to work on projects with people, look at codebases of popular projects on GitHub, and learn as much as you can from senior developers.

#### 7. Git

_Git is a version control system that allows developers working on a team to keep track of all the changes being made to a codebase. It’s important to know a few important things related to Git so that you understand how to properly get the latest code that you’ve missed, update parts of the code, make fixes, and change other people’s code without breaking things. You should definitely learn the concept behind Git and play around with it yourself._

- [x] Here’s a reference list of some common git commands you’ll likely use.
- [x] Here’s a tutorial on using Git and GitHub for beginners.

#### 8. Basic Algorithms & Data Structures

_This topic is somewhat polarizing in the development world because there are developers who don’t think there should be such a heavy focus on computer science topics like tree traversal, sorting, algorithm analysis, matrix manipulation, etc. in web development. However, there are companies like Google that are notorious for asking these types of questions in their interviews. As someone said about the Front-End engineering interview at Google:_

_That said, as Ryan McGrath mentions, our front-end (FE) engineers are expected to have a solid CS background, like all our engineers. While there are companies that practically require applicants to have a computer science degree or equivalent, there are plenty of companies that will hire people without this technical qualification if they can prove that they know how to develop applications and show an understanding of the whole domain. But part of being a competent developer and not writing inefficient code or using the wrong tools is an understanding of some basic algorithms and data structures and being able to analyze trade-offs. So here are some things you should definitely learn:_

- [ ] Improving your Algorithms & Data Structure Skills Article
- [ ] Study hash tables and try to understand them on a deeper level. This data structure underlies objects in JavaScript (dictionaries in Python and hashes in Ruby).
- [ ] Understand how trees and graphs can be beneficial as data structures.
- [x] Understand the basics of Big-O analysis so you don’t do silly things like create a nested loop 3 levels down if you don’t need to!
- [ ] Know when to use an object vs an array and understand the trade-offs.
- [ ] Learn why caching is so important when working with a large amount of data. Also learn the pros and cons of in-memory vs disk storage.
- [x] Learn the difference between queues and stacks.

> Refined the styles for my video grid section inspired by the amazing UX designer [Krista Lacida](http://www.kristalacida.com/contact/). (Video functionality to come later.)

I first coded the play area without flexbox--it was much more classy using flexbox! Also I learned about using the box-shadow for overriding initial text-decorations (including line size and color.)

When implementing the JS, I'll want to find a way to tag the current playing one with an active status and maybe lighten the box... (Or maybe that is pointless, since the video player will be overlaid over the page?)

Anyhow, enjoying how it's coming together ;)

> Learning some of the Laravel file structure and got Bootstrap 4 working on my welcome blade! (I need to get used to running my commands from my Vagrant terminal.) R2D19/#100DaysOfCode

Playing with getting Bootstrap 4 up and running within Laravel 5.6. Shoved some BS4 HTML within the welcome "blade." Some useful code bits to get it working:

CSRF Token seems to help calm a console error.

```html
<meta name="csrf-token" content="{{ csrf_token() }}" />
<link href="{{ asset('css/app.css') }}" rel="stylesheet" />
```

JS after footer:

```html
<script src="{{ asset('js/app.js') }}"></script>
```

I've added some more scss changes to the `resources/assets/sass` folder.

From the ssh on Vagrant, run `npm install` and then compile using `npm run dev` or `npm run watch-poll` (since it doesn't work with just `npm run watch` on my VM). More on these commands from the [Laravel 5.6 docs](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/mix#sass)

## R2 Day 18: 2018-02-28 Wednesday

> Woohoo! I finally have Laravel running on a local Vagrant instance. @jcs224 I hope you are proud! 🎉 It only took me since October. R2D18/#100DaysOfCode

I am probably flip-flopping around too much, but I really want to start building a Bootstrap 4 template of an existing design. I'm hoping to do it using some smart setup, and now I'm researching Laravel again. With Vagrant. With VirtualBox, and Composer.

I got stuck on the [install instructions](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/homestead), thinking that cloning the Homestead repo was if the vagrant homestead library didn't work correctly, but now I understand. ScotchIO's [Getting started with Laravel Homestead](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-laravel-homestead) also helped me over some setup hurdles.

Currently, I'm to the point where I have set up some overrides for my Homestead yaml:

```yaml
# ~/Homestead/Homestead.yaml
---
ip: '192.168.10.10'
memory: 2048
cpus: 1
provider: virtualbox
mariadb: true

authorize: ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

keys:
  - ~/.ssh/id_rsa

folders:
  - map: ~/code
    to: /home/vagrant/code

sites:
  - map: homestead.test
    to: /home/vagrant/code/test/public

  - map: laravel1.test
    to: /home/vagrant/code/laravel1/public

databases:
  - homestead
```

And as luck would have it--now I'm learning how to write better code blocks in Markdown! :)

- [Handy Vagrant commands](https://www.drupal.org/node/2008794)

Now I can `vagrant ssh` and run `composer global require "laravel/installer"`

~~In my folder /home/vagrant/code/test I'm running `laravel new public`...~~

That wasn't exacty right.... Laravel creates it own public folder, so I should run `laravel new test` instead from /home/vagrant/code

But... There is a Laravel homepage showing! This is the furthest Laravel progress I've made.

(Sick today 🤒 but made it through work and finished a giant spreadsheet.) Also registered with Shoreline to go to OmniUpdate conference this March, so that is super exciting!

### Model

The data. Make a nice object literal and stick the information in it. The view should never modify the model directly, and vice versa.

### View

The objects users see on the screen and interact with. If there is a common structure, put it into the HTML. The view functions can then populate those DOM elements.

### Controller

The link between the View and the Model. If someone clicks on an item in the view that changes the data, the _controller_ must be the one to update the model. Controller functions might cause re-renders of views after the data has been changed.

Learned about **5-4-3-2-1** from @smaifullerton-wk: "5,4,3,2,1 is to motivate yourself to do something when you don’t have motivation - all it means is you say in your head 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and then without further thought you get up and start working on the thing. it sounds kinda nutty and obvious but it really works, because it doesn’t give your brain an opportunity to argue against doing whatever it is you don’t feel motivated to do but know you should. It doesn’t really create motivation, it builds discipline to push past resistance to doing good things."

> Better understanding React state & comps with Colt Steele's Advanced Bootcamp & reading up! https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html 66/#100DaysOfCode

A few takeaways from [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)

- Designer's Photoshop layer names may end up being the names of your React components.
- Components that appear within another component in the mock up design should appear as a child in the (folder) hierarchy.
- Build a static version in React (without state) first, and then add in state after all components are ready

And in deciding state, ask three questions about each piece of data:

1. Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
2. Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
3. Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.
