# #100DaysOfCode Round 5

## R5 Day 1: 2022-02-01 Tuesday

- Digging into Pluralsight's [AWS Cloud Practitioner cert](https://app.pluralsight.com/explore/certifications/topics/aws) (doing notes in a guide), setup account
- Need to also look into taking the skill assessment for CSS (and SCSS if available?) and see what gaps I have! 

Learned that this SCSS syntax works for compiling font styles: (thanks LauraBoemo!)

```scss
.myclass {
  font: { 
    family: $theme-font-regular; 
    size: 16px; 
    weight: 300; 
  }
}
```
