## R2 Day 41: 2018-03-24 Saturday

📕 Read chapter 3.1-3.3 of Code Complete on defining program prerequisites.

Determine whether prerequisites need to be defined using a sequential or iterative approach.

➡️ Sequential:

- low risk
- familiar application and implementation
- design is well understood

🔄 Iterative:

- high risk
- unfamiliar application
- complex/hard to understand

❓ Determine problem definition: ask what the problem is using clear language. The "problem definition" should not include a solution or technical jargon.

## R2 Day 40: 2018-03-23 Friday

Made a [PR for Habit100](https://github.com/OppNHeimer/habit100/pull/1) to add in some mobile styling

Code Complete: Read Ch. 1 about construction--what it encompasses, why "coding" is not quite an accurate word (it simply means translating into computer language).

## R2 Day 36: 2018-03-19 Monday

> Reviewing a skills checklist for full-stack developers and noting which areas I still need to focus on. Also, invested in this 900-page book on best practices. Wish me luck! Moved my panda sprite into a responsive grid and started creating a game board for the #freecodecamp Dungeon Crawler challenge. https://virtual.github.io/toy-factory/

### [Full-Stack Developer: The Definitive Guide](https://medium.com/coderbyte/a-guide-to-becoming-a-full-stack-developer-in-2017-5c3c08a1600c)

Reviewing which parts I need to work more on.

#### 1. HTML/CSS

_Almost every single program, whether online or in-person, that is teaching you how to be a web developer will start with HTML and CSS because they are the building blocks of the web. Simply put, HTML allows you to add content to a website and CSS is what allows you to style your content. The following topics related to HTML/CSS come up often in interviews and on the actual job when you’re working:_

- [x] Semantic HTML.
- [x] Be able to explain the CSS Box Model.
- [x] Benefits of CSS preprocessors.
- [x] CSS Media Queries to target different devices and write responsive CSS.
- [x] Bootstrap

#### 2. JavaScript

_The JavaScript language is growing more popular every year and new libraries, frameworks, and tools are constantly being released. Based on the Stack Overflow 2016 Developer Survey, JavaScript is the most popular language in both Full-Stack, Front-end, and Back-end Development. It’s the only language that runs natively in the browser, and can double up as a server-side language as well (as you’ll see below with Node.js). Below are some topics you need to understand as a Full-Stack Developer:_

- [x] Understand how to work with the DOM. Also know what JSON is and how to manipulate it.
- [ ] Important language features such as functional composition, prototypal inheritance, closures, event delegation, scope, higher-order functions.
- [ ] Asynchronous control flow, promises, and callbacks.
- [ ] Learn how to properly structure your code and modularize parts of it, things like webpack, browserify, or build tools like gulp will definitely be helpful to know.
- [x] Know how to use at least one popular framework. (React)
- [x] jQuery
- [ ] Some knowledge on testing frameworks and why they’re important.
- [x] Learn about some important new ES6 features (optional).

#### 3. Back-End Language

_Once you feel you’ve gotten a good grasp on HTML/CSS and JavaScript, you’ll want to move on to a back-end language that will handle things like database operations, user authentication, and application logic. All online programs and bootcamps usually focus on a specific back-end language, and in reality in doesn’t matter which one you learn so much as long as you understand what is going on and you learn the nuances of your chosen language. You’ll get a ton of different responses if you ask someone which back-end language is the best to learn, so below I’ve listed a few popular combinations. An important note: whichever you decide to learn, just stick with it and learn as much as you can about it — there are jobs out there for all the languages listed below._

- [x] Node.js: This is a great option because Node.js is itself just a JavaScript environment which means you don’t need to learn a new language. This is a big reason why a lot of online programs and bootcamps choose to teach Node.js. The most popular framework you’d most likely learn to aid you in developing web applications is Express.
- [ ] Ruby: Some popular frameworks for developing in Ruby are Rails and Sinatra. Plenty of programs teach Ruby as a first back-end language.
- [ ] Python: Some popular frameworks for developing in Python are Django and Flask.
- [ ] Java: The Java language isn’t taught so much these days when it comes to Full-Stack Web Development, but some companies do use Java as their back-end and it is still a very in-demand language (see image above).
- [x] PHP: PHP is rarely taught in programs these days, but just like with Java, it is still very in-demand and it is a cornerstone of the web today.

#### 4. Databases & Web Storage

_When learning to build web applications, at some point you’ll probably want to store data somewhere and then access it later. You should have a good grasp on the following topics related to databases and storage._

- [x] Understand the benefits of relational data, e.g. SQL.
- [x] Learn about NoSQL databases, e.g. MongoDB.
- [x] Understand which would be better in certain situations.
- [x] Know how to connect a database with your chosen back-end language (e.g. Node.js + MongoDB).
- [ ] Understand the benefits of in-memory data stores like Redis or memcached.
- [x] Web storage to store sessions, cookies, and cached data in the browser.
- [ ] Scaling databases, ACID, and ORM (all optional).

#### 5. HTTP & REST

_HTTP is a stateless application protocol on the Internet — it’s what allows clients to communicate with servers (e.g. your JavaScript code can make an AJAX request to some back-end code you have running on a server which will happen via HTTP)._

- [x] What is REST and why is it important in regards to the HTTP protocol and web applications.
- [x] Best practices for designing a RESTful API. POST/GET requests.
- [x] Learning how to use Chrome DevTools can be extremely helpful.
- [x] What are SSL Certificates.
- [ ] HTTP/2 & SPDY (optional).
- [ ] WebSockets, Web Workers, and Service Workers (all optional).

#### 6. Web Application Architecture

_Once you think you have a grasp on HTML/CSS, JavaScript, back-end programming, databases, and HTTP/REST, then comes the tricky part. At this point if you want to create a somewhat complex web application, you’ll need to know how to structure your code, how to separate your files, where to host your large media files, how to structure the data in your database, where to perform certain computational tasks (client-side vs server-side), and much more._

_There are best practices that you can read about online on, but the best way to actually learn about application architecture is by working on a large application yourself that contains several moving parts — or even better, working on a team and together developing a somewhat large/complex application._

_This is why, for example, someone with 7+ years of experience may not necessarily know CSS or JavaScript better than someone with 2 years of experience, but over all of those years they’ve presumably worked with all sorts of different applications and websites and have learned how to architect and design applications (among learning other important things) to be most efficient and can see the “big picture” when it comes to development. Below are some things you can read that will help you learn how to architect your web applications efficiently:_

- [x] Learn about common platforms as a service, e.g. Heroku and AWS. Heroku allows you to easily upload your code and have an application up and running with very little configuration or server maintenance and AWS offers dozens of products and services to help with storage, video processing, load balancing, and much more.
- [ ] Performance optimization for applications and modern browsers.
- [ ] Some opinions on what a web application architecture should include.
- [ ] Designing Web Applications by Microsoft.
- [x] MVC.
- [x] Most importantly though you should try to work on projects with people, look at codebases of popular projects on GitHub, and learn as much as you can from senior developers.

#### 7. Git

_Git is a version control system that allows developers working on a team to keep track of all the changes being made to a codebase. It’s important to know a few important things related to Git so that you understand how to properly get the latest code that you’ve missed, update parts of the code, make fixes, and change other people’s code without breaking things. You should definitely learn the concept behind Git and play around with it yourself._

- [x] Here’s a reference list of some common git commands you’ll likely use.
- [x] Here’s a tutorial on using Git and GitHub for beginners.

#### 8. Basic Algorithms & Data Structures

_This topic is somewhat polarizing in the development world because there are developers who don’t think there should be such a heavy focus on computer science topics like tree traversal, sorting, algorithm analysis, matrix manipulation, etc. in web development. However, there are companies like Google that are notorious for asking these types of questions in their interviews. As someone said about the Front-End engineering interview at Google:_

_That said, as Ryan McGrath mentions, our front-end (FE) engineers are expected to have a solid CS background, like all our engineers. While there are companies that practically require applicants to have a computer science degree or equivalent, there are plenty of companies that will hire people without this technical qualification if they can prove that they know how to develop applications and show an understanding of the whole domain. But part of being a competent developer and not writing inefficient code or using the wrong tools is an understanding of some basic algorithms and data structures and being able to analyze trade-offs. So here are some things you should definitely learn:_

- [ ] Improving your Algorithms & Data Structure Skills Article
- [ ] Study hash tables and try to understand them on a deeper level. This data structure underlies objects in JavaScript (dictionaries in Python and hashes in Ruby).
- [ ] Understand how trees and graphs can be beneficial as data structures.
- [x] Understand the basics of Big-O analysis so you don’t do silly things like create a nested loop 3 levels down if you don’t need to!
- [ ] Know when to use an object vs an array and understand the trade-offs.
- [ ] Learn why caching is so important when working with a large amount of data. Also learn the pros and cons of in-memory vs disk storage.
- [x] Learn the difference between queues and stacks.

## R2 Day 24: 2018-03-07 Wednesday

> Refined the styles for my video grid section inspired by the amazing UX designer [Krista Lacida](http://www.kristalacida.com/contact/). (Video functionality to come later.)

I first coded the play area without flexbox--it was much more classy using flexbox! Also I learned about using the box-shadow for overriding initial text-decorations (including line size and color.)

When implementing the JS, I'll want to find a way to tag the current playing one with an active status and maybe lighten the box... (Or maybe that is pointless, since the video player will be overlaid over the page?)

Anyhow, enjoying how it's coming together ;)

## R2 Day 19: 2018-03-01 Thursday

> Learning some of the Laravel file structure and got Bootstrap 4 working on my welcome blade! (I need to get used to running my commands from my Vagrant terminal.) R2D19/#100DaysOfCode

Playing with getting Bootstrap 4 up and running within Laravel 5.6. Shoved some BS4 HTML within the welcome "blade." Some useful code bits to get it working:

CSRF Token seems to help calm a console error.

```html
<meta name="csrf-token" content="{{ csrf_token() }}" />
<link href="{{ asset('css/app.css') }}" rel="stylesheet" />
```

JS after footer:

```html
<script src="{{ asset('js/app.js') }}"></script>
```

I've added some more scss changes to the `resources/assets/sass` folder.

From the ssh on Vagrant, run `npm install` and then compile using `npm run dev` or `npm run watch-poll` (since it doesn't work with just `npm run watch` on my VM). More on these commands from the [Laravel 5.6 docs](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/mix#sass)

## R2 Day 18: 2018-02-28 Wednesday

> Woohoo! I finally have Laravel running on a local Vagrant instance. @jcs224 I hope you are proud! 🎉 It only took me since October. R2D18/#100DaysOfCode

I am probably flip-flopping around too much, but I really want to start building a Bootstrap 4 template of an existing design. I'm hoping to do it using some smart setup, and now I'm researching Laravel again. With Vagrant. With VirtualBox, and Composer.

I got stuck on the [install instructions](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/homestead), thinking that cloning the Homestead repo was if the vagrant homestead library didn't work correctly, but now I understand. ScotchIO's [Getting started with Laravel Homestead](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-laravel-homestead) also helped me over some setup hurdles.

Currently, I'm to the point where I have set up some overrides for my Homestead yaml:

```yaml
# ~/Homestead/Homestead.yaml
---
ip: '192.168.10.10'
memory: 2048
cpus: 1
provider: virtualbox
mariadb: true

authorize: ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

keys:
  - ~/.ssh/id_rsa

folders:
  - map: ~/code
    to: /home/vagrant/code

sites:
  - map: homestead.test
    to: /home/vagrant/code/test/public

  - map: laravel1.test
    to: /home/vagrant/code/laravel1/public

databases:
  - homestead
```

And as luck would have it--now I'm learning how to write better code blocks in Markdown! :)

- [Handy Vagrant commands](https://www.drupal.org/node/2008794)

Now I can `vagrant ssh` and run `composer global require "laravel/installer"`

~~In my folder /home/vagrant/code/test I'm running `laravel new public`...~~

That wasn't exacty right.... Laravel creates it own public folder, so I should run `laravel new test` instead from /home/vagrant/code

But... There is a Laravel homepage showing! This is the furthest Laravel progress I've made.

Dr Racket is taking a bit too long to download so I'll have to continue that another time.

Began looking at FreeCodeCamp's [Game of Life challenge](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/reGdqx).

## R2 Day 8: 2018-02-18 Sunday

> Created a #javascript30 Clock (02) using CSS transforms and JS. 🕑 A good review of the date functions too! R2D8/#100DaysOfCode

[02-Clock Code](https://github.com/virtual/javascript30/tree/master/02-clock)

## R2 Day 7: 2018-02-17 Saturday

> Edit on update and save completed for my #freecodecamp Recipe App and _submitted!_--all before breakfast! (Since I want some of my data pretty, it only works on new additions.) https://fcc-recipe.herokuapp.com/ R2D7/#100DaysOfCode

Some issues, but I'm so done with this for now:

- Search is no longer functioning; the data is pulling but it gets lost on the way (I think indexing problem)
- Some color accessibility
- Edit form can be prettier

## R2 Day 6: 2018-02-16 Friday

Working on edit functionality for #freecodecamp Recipe box; maybe I'll get the save/update to work tomorrow... No wonder this thing hasn't been finished yet. 😪 R2D6/#100DaysOfCode

✅ Transform text to inputs on form<br/>
✅ Implemented logic for client to pass updated data<br/>
❌ Input boxes need states so they can change<br/>
❌ Server route/Mongo query needed for update <br/>

## R2 Day 5: 2018-02-15 Thursday

> 📚 Another round of working on my media catalog app <br/>
> 🕰️ Added in more session checking <br/>
> 🛍️ Rewrote dashboard so users can view their own collection of movies<br/>
> R2D5/#100DaysOfCode

## R2 Day 4: 2018-02-14 Wednesday

> Finished rewriting [Cat Clicker Premium](https://github.com/virtual/js-design-patterns) using MVC structure. It's such a foreign structure to me... It's so tidy. Seriously digging this @Udacity course from @benjaffe! R2D4/#100DaysOfCode https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud989

(Sick today 🤒 but made it through work and finished a giant spreadsheet.) Also registered with Shoreline to go to OmniUpdate conference this March, so that is super exciting!

### Model

The data. Make a nice object literal and stick the information in it. The view should never modify the model directly, and vice versa.

### View

The objects users see on the screen and interact with. If there is a common structure, put it into the HTML. The view functions can then populate those DOM elements.

### Controller

The link between the View and the Model. If someone clicks on an item in the view that changes the data, the _controller_ must be the one to update the model. Controller functions might cause re-renders of views after the data has been changed.

> 🐱 Working through MVC reorganizing challenges from Udacity Design Patterns with Lesson 2 - Cat Clicker Premium! https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud989 R2D3/#100DaysOfCode

## R2 Day 2: 2018-02-12 Monday

> 🎥 Reorganized my code so my collections can reference IMDb IDs more easily<br/>
> 🔲 Logged in users can click a button-wow!<br/>
> 🎨 Did a little art with a poster placeholder graphic<br/>
> R2D2(🤖 hehe)/#100daysofcode

Learned about **5-4-3-2-1** from @smaifullerton-wk: "5,4,3,2,1 is to motivate yourself to do something when you don’t have motivation - all it means is you say in your head 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and then without further thought you get up and start working on the thing. it sounds kinda nutty and obvious but it really works, because it doesn’t give your brain an opportunity to argue against doing whatever it is you don’t feel motivated to do but know you should. It doesn’t really create motivation, it builds discipline to push past resistance to doing good things."

## R2 Day 1: 2018-02-11 Sunday

> Starting Round 2 of #100DaysOfCode with my React/MySQL project! Join me 😉 <br/>
> ❌ No progress on listing a user's movie collection<br/>
> ☑️ Moved some functions into a React store for better data accessibility<br/>
> 🤔 Planning to do mostly app dev & Javascript30

- Starting a new round! (Commencing Tuesday May 22, 2018)
- Attempted to display a movie tagged in user collection but ran into state errors; I'll need to do a refresher on initialized state, Promises etc.
- Moved movie functions to a new Movie Store on [LibWorx](https://github.com/virtual/libworx)
